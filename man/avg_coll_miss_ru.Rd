\title{generate a matrix of the average percentage of a collection misassigned to a different reporting unit}
\usage{
avg_coll_miss_ru(SL, coll, RU_starts, RU_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{SL}{a scaled likelihood matrix}

\item{coll}{a vector of the collection of origin indices of the fish (length == ncol(SL))}

\item{RU_starts}{a vector delineating starting indices of different reporting units in RU_vec}

\item{RU_vec}{a vector of collection indices, organized by reporting unit}
}
